# Notes

- Must call user Ori and ask clarifications when unsure
- Track unrelated issues here rather than editing immediately
- All written artifacts (commits, docs, code comments) must be in Korean
- Maintain minimal diffs and follow DRY rule
- Org assignment optional in schema (AppUser/JobDescription orgId nullable) per Ori
- Enforce DB-level checks for profile date ranges and JD salary min/max
- Prisma lacks @@check; constraints need manual SQL migration when ready
